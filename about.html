  <h4>Statement</h4>
  <p>
    As a woman, I am accompanied, even when alone, by the image of my own self. I confront myself repeatedly in a refracted mirror of selves and images of selves - enviable and unenviable forms tumbling upon each other like commodities spit out at the end of a conveyor belt. I paint myself as a way to externalize this tumbling and, in so doing, to see it. What do many selfs wear and what pose do they assume when caught off guard, when the scrimmage between particles vying for space becomes fixed? I paint myself in order to find grounding in what is real and what is imagined, in traditions of representation, and traditions of looking and of being looked at.
